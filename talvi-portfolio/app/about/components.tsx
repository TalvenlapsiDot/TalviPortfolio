            I greatly enjoy working with visually beautiful yet simplistic websites, that have large focus on user-friendliness and compatibility.
         <br/><br/>
            This website serves as a portfolio and way for me to present my projects and CV.
         <br/>
            This site has been made using the React library, Next.Js, utilising components from ChakraUI component library.
